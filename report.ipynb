    "In recent years a solution to the data issue we are facing has been to look at expanding our data mining and machine learning algorithms for us to better understand astronomical data by building scalable and usable algorithms to assist us in scientific discovery. The human brain by itself is not nearly capable of comprehending large amounts of high dimensional data and machine learning presents a methodology of exploiting the information to the best of our ability."

    "Machine learning algorithms hopes to achieve a broad range of goals. It aims to reduce human input and find deeper relations which are not immediately obvious to the astronomer. To be able to predict, classify and organise data based on complex relationships. It does this usually by optimising an objective function which tries to contain as much information about the target goal. "
